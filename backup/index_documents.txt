🦠 What is a kidney cyst?
A kidney cyst is a fluid-filled sac that forms in or on the kidney.
Simple cysts: Common, usually benign, often asymptomatic.
Complex or multiple cysts: May require further imaging (CT, MRI) to rule out polycystic kidney disease (PKD) or renal tumors.
🧬 What is a renal tumor?
A renal tumor is an abnormal mass in the kidney.
Benign types: Oncocytomas, angiomyolipomas
Malignant: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
Diagnosis: CT, MRI, ultrasound, and biopsy if needed.
🧪 How is a renal tumor treated?
Depends on tumor type, size, and spread:
Small (<4 cm): Active surveillance or partial nephrectomy
Large/malignant: Radical or partial nephrectomy, ablation therapy
Advanced tumors: Targeted therapy (sunitinib), immunotherapy (nivolumab), systemic therapy, or palliative care
Side effects:
Surgery: Pain, fatigue, infection
Targeted therapy: Fatigue, diarrhea, skin issues
Immunotherapy: Flu-like symptoms, rare autoimmune issues
🪨 What is a kidney stone?
A kidney stone is a hard mineral deposit that forms in the kidneys.
Symptoms:
Severe back/flank pain
Nausea, vomiting
Blood in urine (hematuria)
💊 How is a kidney stone treated?
Small stones: Drink more water, NSAIDs, alpha-blockers (tamsulosin)
Large/obstructive stones: Lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
⚠️ What are the symptoms of kidney disease?
Swelling in legs/ankles
Fatigue or weakness
Foamy/bloody urine
Nausea or metallic taste
High blood pressure
Frequent urination at night
🩺 What is a nephrologist?
A nephrologist is a kidney specialist. They treat:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)
Kidney stones
Hypertension
Electrolyte imbalance
Renal tumors (with oncologists/urologists)
📅 When should I see a nephrologist?
Abnormal creatinine or eGFR
Protein or blood in urine
Recurrent stones or pain
Cystic disease or renal mass
Hypertension not responding to meds
Family history of kidney issues
🧫 Tests for kidney health:
Blood tests: Creatinine, BUN, eGFR, electrolytes
Urine tests: Protein, blood, albumin/creatinine ratio
Imaging: Ultrasound, CT, MRI
Biopsy: For masses, inflammation, advanced diagnostics

🧪 What does my creatinine level mean?
Creatinine Range    Meaning
0.6 – 1.2 mg/dL    Normal (adults)
1.3 – 1.9 mg/dL    Early kidney stress or CKD
2.0+ mg/dL    Likely kidney disease – consult
Check with your doctor for:
eGFR (filtration rate)
Urine protein levels
Kidney imaging

🪨 What is a Kidney Stone?
A kidney stone is a hard deposit of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys due to concentrated urine or imbalance in urine composition.
Symptoms:
Severe lower back or side pain (flank pain)
Blood in urine (hematuria)
Nausea and vomiting
Frequent or painful urination
Types of Stones:
Calcium oxalate (most common)
Uric acid
Struvite
Cystine
Causes:
Low water intake
High oxalate or sodium in diet
Family history
Certain medical conditions (gout, obesity, UTIs)
💊 How is a Kidney Stone Treated?
Treatment options depend on size and location:
Small stones:
Drink 2–3 liters of water daily to flush the stone
Pain relievers (NSAIDs)
Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) to relax ureter muscles
Large or persistent stones:
Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): Breaks stone using shock waves
Ureteroscopy: Scope removes or breaks stone in ureter/kidney
Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): Minimally invasive removal for large stones
Prevention Tips:
Stay hydrated (8–10 glasses water/day)
Reduce salt and animal protein intake
Eat calcium-rich but not excessive calcium
Limit high-oxalate foods: spinach, beets, nuts
